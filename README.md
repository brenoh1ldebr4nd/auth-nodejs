### Resources

If you want to learn more about authentication and understand what exactly is each one of the above functionalities, check out the following resources:

<br/>

- Check this out first, since it explains things step by step in a slideshow format and was my main reference while developing the project. [Tutorial about secure password storing](https://www.martinstoeckli.ch/hash/en/ "Secure Password Storing - Tutorial")

<br/>

- Next, if you want to dig deeper, this class will explore the topic broader, making great points about important aspects in user authentication processes. [MIT Authentication Class - 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MT7X17ZRo1U "MIT Authentication Class")

<br/>

- And if you are focused on the web, this is a great and fast paced video! It also talks about cookies, sessions and all that great web stuff. [Everything you ever wanted to know about authentication](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8Yxff6L_po "Everything you ever wanted to know about authentication")

And don't forget that the internet has a lot more resources, so keep exploring and try to give your users the best experience.
